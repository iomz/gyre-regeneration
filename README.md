gyre-regeneration
=================

Regeneration of GYRE World Reflector.
This project is intended to clone the GYRE omotesando web site which appeared on the web in 2008.
The original was coded with flash, but I decided to replicate it by HTML5 with JavaScript.

Live demo: http://web.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~iomz/gyre/

## Todo
- Fading out effects
- Dynamic audio file production
-- ogg and mp3 conversion
- Realtime text search on the web and quote a certain length
